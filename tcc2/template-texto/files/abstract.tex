  This work presents a proposal for estimating the age of viewers for content suggestion applications on \emph {Smart} TVs using machine learning techniques. Such a tool can be used in a variety of ways, including to facilitate the collection of information that contributes to a better content delivery experience, to the creation and control of custom settings, and to the implementation of more efficient parental control strategies.
